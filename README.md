# FGMWeatherServiceAPI
This project is a .NET 6 Web API that provides weather data based on location or city name. The weather data includes temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and sunrise time. The API interacts with the Open-Meteo API to retrieve real-time weather information and caches results in a MongoDB database.
